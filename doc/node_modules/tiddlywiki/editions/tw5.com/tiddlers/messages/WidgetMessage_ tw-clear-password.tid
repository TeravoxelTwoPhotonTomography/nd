title: WidgetMessage: tw-clear-password
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The `tw-clear-password` message clears the current password from the password vault, clearing the [[$:/isEncrypted]] tiddler. See EncryptionMechanism for details.

This message is typically generated with the ButtonWidget, and is handled by the core itself.
