title: TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb allows content to be synchronised between TiddlyWiki running in the browser and a TiddlyWeb (or TiddlySpace) server. Features include:

* Lazy loading
* Two way synchronisation between the browser and the server
** Synchronising from the server is accomplished by polling (currently every 60 seconds)
* Throttling so that rapidly changing tiddlers don't overwhelm the server

The implementation is somewhat experimental, and includes these limitations:

* Only works with tiddlers written in TiddlyWiki version 5 WikiText. Tiddlers in the old syntax will be parsed as TiddlyWikiClassic syntax
* New tiddlers are not saved to the server
* No way to delete tiddlers

To try out TiddlyWiki in the Sky for TiddlyWeb:

# If necessary, create an account at http://tiddlyspace.com/
# Create a new space, eg `<myspace>`
# Include the space `tw5tiddlyweb`
# Visit `http://<myspace>.tiddlyspace.com/tw5`
