Widget messages are generated by widgets in response to user actions. They flow up the widget tree until they are handled by an ancestor widget.

The following widget messages are implemented by the core:

<ul>
<$list filter="[tag[message]]">
<li>
<$link to={{!!title}}>
<$view field="title"/>
</$link>
</li>
</$list>
</ul>
