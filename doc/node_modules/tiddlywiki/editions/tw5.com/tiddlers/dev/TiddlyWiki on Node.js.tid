type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Running TiddlyWiki on [[Node.js]] brings several important benefits over and above the single file version:

* You can edit your content on any suitably compatible HTML5 browser, including smartphones and tablets
* Individual tiddlers are stored in separate files, which you can organise as you wish
* The ability to build multiple wikis that blend different combinations of shared and unique content
