/** \defgroup ndops nD Operators
 *
 *   Basic type-generic operations for N-dimensional arrays.
 *
 *   All operations use the strided order of input and output arrays; the caller
 *   must set these up ahead of time.  The output arrays and the buffers they
 *   reference must be allocated and setup before calling.
 *
 *   \todo [doc] Add description of strided array access and illustration of
 *               how operators work on subvolumes.
